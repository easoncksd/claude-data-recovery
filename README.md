# Claude Data Recovery

Turn an official Claude data export into a private, searchable offline viewer and a portable Markdown archive.

Claude Data Recovery runs locally, uses only the Python standard library, and never uploads your conversations.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Claude exports can contain private conversations, account details, memories, and extracted attachment text. Never commit your export or generated recovery output to GitHub.

## Browser generator

This repository also includes an experimental static browser generator in `web/`.
It keeps the generated offline viewer separate from the import UI, so the existing
viewer layout is not replaced.

Open `web/index.html` or `web/generator.html` in a browser, choose the official
Claude export `.zip` file, then generate the local recovery viewer. You can also
choose an already-extracted export folder that contains `conversations.json`.

All parsing happens in the browser. The export is not uploaded.

## What it creates

- A single-file offline web viewer with full-text search and filters
- One Markdown file per conversation
- A normalized JSON archive
- Memory and project recovery notes
- A data-quality report with best-effort Unicode repair
- Optional account metadata and an appeal checklist for your own local use

## Supported export files

| File | Support |
| --- | --- |
| `conversations.json` | Conversation messages, structured content, tools, thinking blocks, attachments |
| `design_chats/*.json` | Best-effort recovery of Claude design chats |
| `memories.json` | Conversation and project memories |
| `projects/*.json` | Project metadata and instructions |
| `users.json` | Local account verification notes |

Only `conversations.json` is required.

## Quick start

Requires Python 3.10 or newer.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MindLeap-AI-Labs/claude-data-recovery.git
cd claude-data-recovery

python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e .

claude-data-recovery "/path/to/extracted/claude-export" \
  --output "./claude-recovery-output"
```

Then open:

```text
claude-recovery-output/index.html
```

You can also point the command directly at `conversations.json`:

```bash
claude-data-recovery "/path/to/conversations.json"
```

## 中文快速开始

这个工具会在本地解析 Claude 官方数据导出，生成可搜索的离线网页、逐条对话 Markdown、记忆导入文本和项目恢复资料。整个过程不会上传数据。

```bash
claude-data-recovery "/你的/Claude导出文件夹" -o "./恢复结果"
```

生成后，直接用浏览器打开 `恢复结果/index.html`。

## Output structure

```text
claude-recovery-output/
├── index.html
├── normalized_data.json
├── README_RECOVERY.md
├── memory_import.md
├── project_recovery.md
├── account_appeal.md
└── markdown/
    └── 2026-01-01_001_example_conversation_ab12cd34.md
```

## Privacy design

- No network requests
- No analytics or tracking
- No API keys
- No third-party Python dependencies
- Text is rendered safely instead of injecting exported HTML
- Common export filenames are excluded by `.gitignore`

The generated `index.html` embeds your recovered data so it can be opened offline. Treat that file as sensitive.

## Known limitations

- Anthropic does not publish a stable schema for every export field, so parsing is best-effort.
- Exported data cannot recreate the original Claude sidebar in another personal account.
- Some attachment binaries may not be present; extracted attachment text is preserved when available.
- Very large exports create a correspondingly large single HTML file.

## Development

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
python -m claude_data_recovery tests/fixtures/sample_export -o /tmp/claude-recovery-demo
```

The test fixture is synthetic and contains no real user data.

Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening a pull request. Please never attach a real Claude export to an issue; provide a minimal synthetic fixture instead.

## Security

For privacy or security problems, follow [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). Do not disclose conversation exports in public issues.
